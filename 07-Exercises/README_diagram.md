The diagram depicts a professional setup of a centralized Security Operations Center (SOC) log management and monitoring infrastructure deployed in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Below is an analysis:
Components:

    1.SOC Analyst Laptop:
        Acts as the point of interaction for the SOC analyst.
        Connects to Elastic/Kibana over the internet using a web GUI to monitor logs and alerts.

    2.Attack Laptop (Kali Linux):
        Represents a potential threat actor's system for launching cyberattacks.
        Communicates with the Command and Control (C2) server, which facilitates malicious activities like malware deployment or exfiltration.

    3.VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
        Network range: 172.31.0.1/24, used to host the infrastructure.
        Consists of various servers for log aggregation, management, and ticketing.

    4.Elastic & Kibana Server:
        Serves as the central logging and visualization tool.
        Collects logs from managed systems (Windows and Ubuntu servers) through agents.
        Generates alerts and forwards them to the OS Ticket server for incident tracking.

    5.OS Ticket Server:
        A ticketing system used to handle alerts and incidents raised by Elastic.
        SOC analysts manage and resolve tickets through this server.

    6.Fleet Server:
        Manages Elastic Agents deployed across client systems.
        Responsible for collecting, managing, and forwarding logs to the Elastic server.

    7.Windows Server:
        RDP-enabled server integrated into the logging system via an Elastic Agent.
        Sends system logs to the Fleet Server.

    8.Ubuntu Server:
        SSH-enabled server also integrated into the logging system via an Elastic Agent.
        Sends logs to the Fleet Server.

*Workflow:

    Logs are generated on the Windows and Ubuntu servers.
    These logs are forwarded to the Fleet Server via managed agents.
    The Fleet Server forwards the collected logs to the Elastic & Kibana server for analysis, visualization, and alert generation.
    Alerts generated by Elastic are forwarded to the OS Ticket server for incident management.
    SOC analysts monitor Elastic/Kibana for real-time log visualization and interact with the OS Ticket system for incident resolution.

*Purpose:

 This architecture is designed for:

    Centralized log management.
    Monitoring and detecting security incidents.
    Tracking and managing incidents via ticketing.
    Investigating potential threats (e.g., attacks from the C2 server or other malicious activities).
